Simulation files have tree structure and consist of several root objects that have multiple child objects, but for simplicity and reusability, in schema those parameters are defined as flat list.\n[\n    \"paramName1\": {...},\n    \"paramName2\": {...}\n]The order in which parameters are defined in schema does not matter, as long as all parameters that other parameters depend on are defined. There are several parameter types:\n\nSimple - this parameter type consists of single floating, integer or string value. It cannot have any child parameters. Example of such parameters in simulation file - sigma, gamma and scale are simple parameters.\n\n\"parameters\": {\n    \"sigma\": \"5\",\n    \"gamma\": \"2\",\n    \"scale\": \"10\"\n}Definition for such parameter in configurationSchema.json looks like this:\n\"sigma\": {\n    \"type\": \"simple\",\n    \"description\": \"Some parameter description\",\n    \"parameterType\": \"int\",\n    \"minValue\": 0,\n    \"maxValue\": 1000,\n    \"defaultValue\": 1\n},\nEnum - enum parameter is parameter that changes its child parameters based on its class - saturation is an example of such parameter - it has two possible classes inverse_generalized_exponential and genralized_exponential\n\n\"saturation\": {\n    \"class\": \"inverse_generalized_exponential\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"sigma\": \"10\",\n        \"gamma\": \"2\",\n        \"scale\": \"1000\"\n    }\n},Same parameter with different class would look like this:\n\"saturation\": {\n    \"class\": \"generalized_exponential\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"sigma\": \"5\",\n        \"gamma\": \"2\",\n        \"scale\": \"10\"\n    }\n}Definition for such parameter in schema:\n\"saturation\": {\n    \"type\": \"enum\",\n    \"description\": \"Some description\",\n    \"possibleClasses\": [\n        \"generalized_exponential\",\n        \"inverse_generalized_exponential\"\n    ],\n    \"defaultValue\": \"generalized_exponential\"\n}\nComplex - this parameter type has one or more simple, complex or enum children. In example below generalized_exponential is such parameter - it has 3 simple children.\n\n\"saturation\": {\n    \"class\": \"generalized_exponential\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"sigma\": \"5\",\n        \"gamma\": \"2\",\n        \"scale\": \"10\"\n    }\n},mutator is an example of complex parameter with complex children :\n\"mutator\": {\n    \"efficiency\": {\n        \"class\": \"uniform_step\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"increase_length\": \"0.1\",\n            \"decrease_length\": \"1.0\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"resistance\": {\n        \"class\": \"uniform_step\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"increase_length\": \"0.1\",\n            \"decrease_length\": \"1.0\"\n        }\n    }\n}Definition of such parameter is analogous to enum parameter, but instead of possibleClasses that parameter can have, array of childClasses is defined:\n\"mutator\": {\n    \"type\": \"complex\",\n    \"description\": \"Mutator description\",\n    \"childClasses\": [\"efficiency\", \"resistance\"]\n},Schema validation\nThe configurationSchema.json file is added to program during build, and schema validity is checked during build. There are several build-time checks:\n\nall classes in possibleClasses and childClasses must be defined in schema, to ensure that some parameter does not depend on non existing parameter.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
